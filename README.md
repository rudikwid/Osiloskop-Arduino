# Osiloskop-Arduino
mod version from https://github.com/wayri/Arduino-Oscilloscope

the main display is working, but without control buttons the Mitsunaga oscilloscope is useless.

I have been built the original version and working good as expected. there are 11 push buttons.

from main display, we can control Volt/Division, Time Base, independently for dual channels.
if we press the Menu Button, we can activate or deactivate channel 1 and channel 2. also how we connect the trigger related to which channel.
as submenu, there also trigger threshold level to adjust the thereshold sensitivity.
